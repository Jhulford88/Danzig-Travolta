            <h2><em>You all knew it... We just dared to say it...</em></h2>
            <p>You've known it for years. We all have. There's really no denying it. You see their faces.
                Its plain and obvious. Glenn Danzig and John Travolta <em>are the same person!</em>
                Sure, you try to ignore it, even deny it. But you can't. None of us can. We're through
                the looking glass here people!

            <p>They may have gotten away with their little ruse for some time, but no longer. Thanks to
                the dedication of our renowned community of sleuths, they can no longer hide from the
                fact that we all already knew. <em>Glenn Danzig and John Travolta are the same person</em>
